# v3

## algorithm.py
    - Added more colors ("Killed" and "Best from set") to the list of available constants.

## algorithm_*.py
    - BUG: The number of the frame being returned for all frames was decreased by 1 making the
           frame '0' to appear twice.

## Class `AlignmentNode`
    - Added the property `coords` that returns a tuple with the number of letters consumed in each
      of the sequences in the respective node.

## Class `Alignment`
    - Added the method `compact` that replaces all sub trees bellow a given level by a single node
      counting the number of children in the sub-tree.

    - Implemented the `ignore` parameter in the method `expand`. The nodes are marked as expanded
      but do not generate the respective chidren.

    - Changed the method `get_solution` to return the best solution if many are available.

    - Added the method `get_by_coords` to return all nodes with the given coords.

## Class `Simulation`:
    - Added an extra parameter `start_step` to the method `movie`. Now it generates only the frames
      from `start_step` to `max_step` instead of all frames from 0 to `max_steps`.

# v2

## simulation.py:
    - Removed the useless color constants from the file.

## Alignment.expand():
    - Added the argument `kill` to mark an alignment as expanded without actually expanding it.

## AlgorithmDynamicProgramming:
    - Added the Dynamic programming algorithm to the code base.

## demo.ipynb:
     - Added the demo for the Dynamic Programming algorithm.


# v1 - First complete version of the code.
