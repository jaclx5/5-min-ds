As a lot of other people, I believe that teaching and writing about a subject is the most effective way to learn and understand it. This blog is my pretext to learn and, at the same time, to share.

In short posts, that could be read in 5 minutes or less, I share my passion about data, science, machine learning, programming and technology in general.

I hope you enjoy! If you have any comments, suggestions or corrections, please, feel free to drop me a message.

Cheers!
