_In the [previous post](/sequence_alignments_2) I formally defined sequence alignments and described a way to compute a score for how "good" an alignment is. This score allows us to compare alignments between two sequences against each other which is key to help us find the best alignment of all, the optimal one. In this post I will start exploring algorithms to automatically find this optimal alignment between two sequences._

# Alignment Algorithms

If you have been following the previous posts of this series you have learned quite bit about alignments. Lets recap a few things we learned so far:
- An alignment between two sequences $$A$$ and $$B$$ is a sequence of operations over $$A$$ that turn it into $$B$$;
- A huge number of distinct alignments exist between $$A$$ and $$B$$;
- It is possible to compute a score of how "good" each of those alignments is;
- And, finally, we call the alignment with the highest score the __optimal alignment__.

Now, our next challenge will be to __design an algorithm that finds the optimal alignment between any two given sequences__.

## A Little Bit of Notation 

Before moving on, let's add some notation to help us describe the algorithms to be developed.

An alignment algorithm is a set of mechanical rules applied, sequentially, step by step. I will illustrate the algorithms in this post with ternary trees like the one bellow:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/images/sequence_alignments/notation_1.png" height="250"/>
</div>

Each individual tree is snapshot of a given step of the algorithm. Each node in the tree corresponds to a partial alignment being explored. The tree depicts all the partial alignments explored up to that step.

Each node in the tree contains the following extra information:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/images/sequence_alignments/notation_2.png" height="250"/>
</div>

Note that the following two nodes correspond to two distinct partial alignments, with distinct sequences of operations:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/images/sequence_alignments/notation_3.png" height="100"/>
</div>

Both, however, consumed $$3$$ elements of sequence $$A$$ and $$2$$ elements of sequence $$A$$. Hence, we can say that both alignments belong to the $$Aln_{3, 2}$$ set.

Generalizing, the set $$Aln_{i, j}$$ contains all alignments that consume $$i$$ elements from sequence $$A$$ and $$j$$ elements from sequence $$B$$.

Finally, certain special nodes will be shown with particular colors. the __<span style="color:#ff0000;">red</span>__ node represents the best "non expanded" alignment observed so far, the __<span style="color:#00ff00;">green</span>__ node represents the expanded node that originated the current state, and the __<span style="color:#0000ff;">blue</span>__ one represents the solution whenever we find it. Note that the a solution requires that all elements of both sequences have been "consumed", thus, the partial alignments are only intermediate steps until a solution is reached.

Now, the algorithms.

## Greedy Approach - A False Start

Our first attempt to build an alignment algorithm will be a straightforward, although _na√Øve_, way to search for the optimal alignment. This algorithm systematically explores all possible alignment operations in each step of the way, "greedily" choosing the next search direction according to the best score found so far.

The images bellow illustrate this __greedy__ algorithm applied to our [already familiar sequences](/sequence_alignments_2#external1): <code class="python">POINTER</code> and <code class="python">PUNTER</code>, respectively our sequences $$A$$ and $$B$$.

Click on the left and right arrows, or in the bottom circles to navigate the steps of the algorithm.

{% include slideshow.html slideshow=page.greedy1 %}

In the first step, the algorithm starts with an _empty_ alignment ($$\text{empty} \in Aln_{0,0}$$) with an score of 0 (zero), and "expands" it by applying the three possible operations:

- an __INSERT__ in $$A_1$$, obtaining the partial alignment $$\text{(P/-)} \in Aln_{1,0}$$ with a score of -2.
- a __MATCH__ between $$A_1$$ and $$B_1$$, obtaining $$\text{(P/P)} \in Aln_{1,1}$$ with a score of 3.
- a __DELETION__ of $$A_i$$, obtaining $$\text{(-/P)} \in Aln_{0,1}$$ with a score of -2.

Next, it chooses the best node found so far (thus the __greedy__ in the algorithm's name) and repeats the same expansion process. The algorithm keeps "expanding" the best node, until it "exhausts" both sequences.

As it progresses, the algorithm recursively builds a ternary tree that contains in its leaves many the possible alignments.

Notice that, due to the accumulation of gaps and mismatches, in some steps (e.g., steps 4 and 7), the next best alignment to be explored doesn't always result from the one previously expanded. In these cases the algorithm "backtracks" to explore other branches of the expansion tree.

Although the algorithm seems to be, at a first glance, pretty effective, it has a major flaw. __As it usually occurs with greedy algorithms, it often fails to find the optimal alignment__.

Take, for example, this other pair of sequences, <code class="python">ABC</code> and <code class="python">ABXABC</code>:

{% include slideshow.html slideshow=page.greedy2 %}

As we can see in this example, the greediness of the algorithm, and the fact that it stops as soon as it founds a possible solution, leads to the following sub-optimal alignment ($$(\text{ABC---/ABXABC}) \in Aln_{3,6}$$) as a solution:

{% highlight markdown %}
    ABC---
    ||x---
    ABXABC
{% endhighlight %}

$$(2 \times 3) + (1 \times -1) + (3 \times -2) = -1$$

How do I know this is not the optimal alignment? Because, with a little manual effort, I can find an alignment with a higher score:

{% highlight markdown %}
    AB---C
    ||---|
    ABXABC
{% endhighlight %}

$$(3 \times 3) + (0 \times -1) + (3 \times -2) = 3$$

Of course it is impossible, for all but the shortest alignments, to manually verify if a specific solution is the optimal one or not. The point I am making here is that, with this simple counter-example, I can prove that the greedy approach some times fails.

At least in the sequence alignment world, greed doesn't pay of.

## Brute Force - Almost There

One way to overcame the limitations of the greedy algorithm is to continue exploring the alignment space, even after having found a first solution, by backtracking and exploring all remaining possibilities. This systematic search over all possibilities is commonly called a "__Brute Force__" strategy, i.e., to test all possibilities and make sure that the optimal alignment is never missed.

Mechanically, both algorithms are pretty similar, the main difference between the greedy and the brute force algorithms is the stopping condition. While the former stops at the first solution, the latter keeps searching until all solutions have been tested.

Of course, due to the huge number of possible alignments, the brute force approach is completely impractical for all but the smallest sequences.

The bravest readers may want to take a look, at their own risk, at the complete brute force expansion of the alignment between <code class="python">ABC</code> and <code class="python">ABXABC</code>:

<div align="center">
    <a href="/images/sequence_alignments/full_brute_force.png"><img src="/images/sequence_alignments/full_brute_force.png" height="500"/></a>
</div>

If you search patiently, you will spot the optimal alignment, mentioned above, in a branch near the center of the image:

<div align="center">
    <img src="/images/sequence_alignments/full_brute_force_detail.png"/>
</div>

# Next Steps

At his point you may ask: "_Why are we wasting time with flawed and impractical algorithms?_".

That's a good question and I have a couple of good answers:
 
First, a simple algorithm, even if it is inefficient and impractical, is a good proof of concept to show that an algorithm to find optimal alignments indeed exists (which is not always the case for every problem).

Second, and most important, understanding how a basic algorithm works allows us to gain some familiarity with the problem, which will make it much easier to understand the really useful algorithms that we will discuss later.

Fortunately, we still can find the optimal alignment without having to explore all possible alignments. The solution is a technique call Dynamic Programming and that is what we will see in the next post.

# The Code

You can reproduce all the images from this post using the [companion notebook](https://github.com/jaclx5/jaclx5.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/sequence_alignment/alignment_tree/demo.ipynb).

In the repository you will find the package [dalt](https://github.com/jaclx5/jaclx5.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/sequence_alignment/alignment_tree/dalt) which allows you to try your own algorithms and see the resulting trees.

__It's important to note that the algorithms in this package ARE NOT efficient and ARE NOT intended to be used in any practical way. They were developed uniquely to illustrate the concepts in this post and to generate graphical representations of alignments for pedagogic purposes.__
