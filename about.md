I'm a software engineer by training and data scientist by trade, with a PhD in Bioinformatics. I'm currently based in Lisbon, Portugal.

I spend most of my professional time coding, creating data science models and managing a team of amazing Data Science professionals. I also teach, study and write.

Personally I live in the amazing city of Lisbon with my wife and 2 children. Living in Lisbon gives me the opportunity to enjoy more than 300 sunny days a year, the perfect weather for long distance swimming, biking and running.
